# Apprise

Apprise, much like the definition of the word, is a tool to inform a group of people. I originally developed the tool as an alert system that could broadcast to a user base.

The basic framework can be used for just about anything that needs to pass information from the web to a server's file system.

Be aware that there has not been a lot of security built around the tool yet as its intended purpose when I created it was for an internal network.

This couldn't have been possible without a ton of code help from Greg Wells.
